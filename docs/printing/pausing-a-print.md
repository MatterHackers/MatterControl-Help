# Setting up Pause and Resume G-Code
If you printer has not already been setup to handle Pause and Resume (if you are creating a new printer profile) - you can change the behavior of Pause and Resume in the printer G-Code settings. This is an advanced option and if you are using an included profile 'Pause' and 'Resume' should already be setup correctly.
