MatterControl 2.0 is here-the premiere of the newest version of MatterHackers' free, open-source 3D printing software! This All-In-One design/slice/print program comes jam-packed with all-inclusive features that you can access through a new sleek, accessible interface. Makers asked for an enhanced 3D printing experience and the MatterControl Development Team delivered. MatterControl 2.0 provides design capabilities and print-protection features that allow quality 3D printing for both beginners and experienced users. Take ultimate control over how 3D prints turn out by having quick, easy access to a number of printer settings this software provides. Down below are just some of the many customizable features MatterControl 2.0 has to offer to help users achieve the 3D printing experience makers specifically need.

# Design Tools

MatterControl 2.0 empowers users with the ability to design and model anything that can be imagined, in a single program. Add and subtract basic objects together to create interesting and complex designs that can be printed right after modeling. Choose from a variety of primitives in the Design Tools to create fresh models right in the program or use them to add finishing touches to an existing model already made. The possibilities are endless for all skill levels! Want to learn more about the power makers have with MatterControl 2.0's Design Tools?

# Design Apps

MatterControl 2.0's Design Apps lets makers add quick, personal touches to pre-made models that can be easily used for practical application. Need a business card holder with a name on it? How about a name tag with a company logo on it? No problem! Our Design App has it all covered. This feature is perfect for both beginners who want to get their feet wet designing before jumping into modeling and also for seasoned modelers who need a quicker way to create multiple, uniquely personalized prints of the same model.

# Customizable Supports

Makers can choose what kind of supports they want for their 3D prints. Whether auto-generated supports is the ideal go-to or specifically design supports for particular parts of the model is more desirable, MatterControl 2.0 offers both options for the maker. Use Design Tools to simply drag-and-drop in a primitive, mark it as support, and MatterControl will treat it as supports for that model. Support internal structures without having to support the entire model based on makers' personal customizations.

# Re-Slice

Actively edit and slice 3D models mid-print to avoid potential print fails using MatterControl 2.0's new Re-Slice feature. Save time, effort, and filament when adjusting models during a print job and seamlessly continue printing. Need to delete only one piece out of a batch that's currently printing without disrupting the printing session? Delete that piece, hit the “Re-Slice” button, and MatterControl will continue printing everything, minus that piece that was just deleted. This is one of many scenarios Re-Slice can resolve so makers don't have to start over and waste filament. Beginners who are still getting the hang of 3D printing and experts who like to experiment with their projects can easily take advantage of this new feature. Rest easy knowing Re-Slice is another arsenal MatterControl 2.0 has to offer from its armory of robust print-protection features.

# Printer Slice Settings & Controls

Successful 3D printing is easier to achieve with MatterControl 2.0. Some makers like to let the software take control and other makers have a strong preference over their print settings. Regardless of preference, MatterControl is able to satisfy various levels of print control for beginners and veterans. MatterControl comes with pre-determined print settings for common filaments such as PLA and ABS so when makers open up this software, they can select which filament they're printing with, hit print, and get successful results. Need more control? Check out a whole bunch of new settings makers can tinker with under Slice Settings and Controls. From Speed and Support, right down to the type of infill, makers have complete control over which settings satisfy their print needs for successful 3D printing.
