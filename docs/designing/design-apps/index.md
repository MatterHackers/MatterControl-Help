MatterControl has the tools to enable designing and creating your own models and 3D prints. With an array of new tools called "Design Tools" you can now combine and subtract different parts together to create something brand new and your own. But if that still sounds a little too intimidating for you we have an answer for that too: Design Apps. Rather than having to create a 3D model entirely from scratch, instead you have several parameters you can change to make it fit exactly what you need.
