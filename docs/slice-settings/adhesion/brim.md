A brim is an expansion of the first layer of your print. It consists of a series of extra loops connected to the print around the first layer.

The purpose of a brim is to provide better bed adhesion by giving the print more area to stick to the bed. If a print has a very small contact area with the bed it can be dislodged during printing.

A brim can also help with large print which are prone to warping and peeling in the corners. The brim helps hold the corners down and prevents this from happening.

A brim must be sliced off after printing. This can be done easily with a hobby knife or a deburring tool.
