# What is the optimal layer height?

In reality, there is no “perfect” layer height. It all depends on what kind of print you are going for. If you want a print with a smooth finish and very fine details, you want a layer height of 0.1 - 0.2. If you want something a little rougher, perhaps a part in a bigger assembly, a layer height of .21 - 0.3 is more suited to your needs. You can of course have a larger layer height, but you cannot make a layer higher than the diameter of the nozzle.

# How much infill should I use?

The amount of infill in your part directly relates to how solid it is. Would you like a completely solid part? 100% infill is what you need. Something hollow? 0% infill will leave you with nothing but the outside layers. Usually to have a strong part, you only need about 35% infill. Most parts will be fully functional with about 15% percent infill. For really big parts, a smaller percentage is recommended, as increasing it unnecessarily can waste materials and increase print time.

# How do I stop the fan from coming on during printing?

Set both the Minimum Fan Speed and Maximum Fan Speed to 0.

# What does support material do?
When you check the Generate Support Material box, your print will contain support material. This is used to provide support in areas of a design that are otherwise suspended in the air, such as a bridge or a ledge. The properties will change depending on which slice engine you use.

# What is the the optimal temperature for printing?

That all depends on the type of filament you are using. The right temperature can also be affected by the filament dye, and manufacturer. Here is the recommended starting point for each filament:

- **PLA**		190-210°C
- **ABS**		220-240°C
- **PET**		240-250°C
- **NYLON**		240-250°C
- **LAYWOOD**		175-250°C
- **LAYBRICK**		165-210°C
- **SOFT PLA/BENDLAY/TPE**		220-235°C
- **GLOW IN THE DARK PLA**		185-205°C
- **PVA**		170-190°C

Using these guidelines, you can find a temperature that works for your particular filament. You can also use these to configure your temperature presets.

# What is the optimal temperature for the heated bed?
Again, this depends on the filament that you’re using. Here are the recommended starting points.

- **PLA**		70-80°C
- **ABS/NYLON**		100-120°C
- **SOFT PLA/BENDLAY/TPE**		65-85°C

Using these guidelines, you can find a temperature that works for your particular filament. You can also use these to configure your temperature presets.
